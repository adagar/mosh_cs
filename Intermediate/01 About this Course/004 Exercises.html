I want to make a push you to find the solutions yourself and make a better programmer out of you. In the real-world, your job as a software engineer is to solve unsolved problems. The solutions are not there. You need to use your knowledge and do some research to find them. This is what distinguishes you from an average programmer. </p><p><br></p><p>Once you do the exercise, watch the videos in the last section of the course: <strong>Student's Code Reviews</strong>. Listen to my commentary about what is good in their code and what can be improved. </p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: Please watch these videos "before" submitting your code here for me to review. </strong>I've had quite a few students asking me for code reviews and all their solutions exhibit similar issues that I've already talked about in those videos. To save your and my time, please watch those videos first and if you still need help, feel free to post in the discussions area. </p><p><strong><br></strong></p></p>
