1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,180
So in this section you learn that we have two main categories of types in C Sharp on one side we've

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,580
got crosses on the other side we've got structures examples of class those are strings arrays for any

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,790
custom classes that you create.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,910
Examples of structures are all the primitive types like integer character float and any custom structures

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,050
that you create.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,630
The difference between the two types is purely memory management and you can review that again in the

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,100
lecture hall reference types versus value types.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,170
Now from the next section things start to get really interesting because I'm going to teach you about

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,780
control flow and you'll be able to write simple C-Sharp programs and then in each section you will learn

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,580
something new about C-Sharp and you'll be able to write more interesting programs.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,780
So I was here the next section
