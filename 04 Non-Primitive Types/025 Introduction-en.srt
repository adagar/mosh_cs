00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:10,320
In this section I'm going to talk about non primitive types since the show it's just classes structures

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,460
arrays strings and genomes.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,620
And then I'm going to talk about a very important topic called refaced types versus T-tops which is

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,780
about memory management of different types.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,650
So let's get started.
