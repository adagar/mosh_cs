1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,090
So in this section you learn about conditional and iteration statements and C-sharp.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,890
I hope you'll spend some time doing your exercises if you have been programming for a while.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,210
Don't say no more.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,220
I have done this a million times before it's too easy for me.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,850
Trust me these exercises help you become a better programmer and that's what we're going to do from

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,210
this section onwards.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,510
So in every section again you're going to see a number of programming exercises and they gradually get

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,600
more challenging.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,080
So do your exercises and I'll see you in the next section.
