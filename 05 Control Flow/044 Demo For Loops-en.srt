1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,650
OK imagine we want to display the list of even numbers from 1 to 10.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,740
So we need to loop to go over the list of numbers between 1 to 10 and for each number we need to check

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,660
the remainder of its division by 2.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,190
And if it's zero that means it's an even number.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,850
So let's start with a for loop

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,700
.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,860
So with this loop we said I to 1.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,550
And as long as it is less than or equal to 10 in each iteration we increment I buy one.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,910
Now we need to check the remainder of division of I by 2.

10
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:58,110
So if that's zero we want to display I on the console just like let's run the application.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,620
So we got 2 4 6 8 and 10.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,240
Now what if we want to reverse this order.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
Let's try this program again.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,790
So this time

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm going to create another for loop but instead of starting from 1 I start from 10

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,970
and I change the condition to as long as I is greater than or equal to 1 then I am minus minus which

17
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,020
means decrement.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,440
I buy one.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,090
Now we are going to have the same condition

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,360
cancel the right line.

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,350
So let's run the application again.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,180
OK now you see in the second part we start from 10 and then we have 8 6 4 and 2
