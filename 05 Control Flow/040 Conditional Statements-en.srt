00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,870
OK we got to conditional statements in this lecture.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,440
We're going to talk about the language constructs of C-Sharp that are used we're controlling the program

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,530
execution and C-Sharp we have two types of conditional statements.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,920
We have else.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,710
And we have switch and case we also have a conditional operator which is basically a short way of writing

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,270
an infant else.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,550
Let's take a closer look at each of these statements.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,620
Here's the basic structure of if statements with if we always have a condition which is enclosed in

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,710
prothesis followed by a statement that will be executed if the condition is true.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,100
We can actually have an LCF with another condition and again another statement that will be executed

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,070
if the condition is true and optionally we can have an Elsin statement.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:01:00,120
So if none of the earlier conditions is true then this piece of code will be executed if we have more

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,100
than one line of code after if or else statements we always need to enclose them with curly braces.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,130
We can also use that if we have only one line of code.

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,980
You can also nest if statements inside each other.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,170
So here as you see I have got an if statement.

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,220
And inside this body I've got another if an else statement.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,050
Now one thing I want to warn you is to avoid using multiple nested if statements multiple nested if

19
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,620
statements result in code that is hard to read are to understand hard to maintain and hard to test.

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
So that's what we call a code smell.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,320
And that's something you should avoid at all times.

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,480
So each is slightly different from if with if we usually have a condition that is evaluated and if it's

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,290
true and some piece of code will be executed with switch however we have a valuable and we compared

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,260
the value of that variable with different values.

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,240
So in this case I have a switch on a variable here called Roll which is an enumeration.

26
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,490
I have two case statements here.

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,130
At least we should always have one but you can have more depending on your circumstances.

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,330
So I'm comparing the value of roll with this one here roll down the admin.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,480
So if the rollies is admin then this piece of code will be executed.

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,820
And note that each case statement is terminated by Brecqhou statement.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,330
Then I have another case statement.

32
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,520
So if the role is moderator then this piece of code will be executed.

33
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,320
If none of these conditions is true then the default block would be executed.

34
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,090
And of course we need to have a break statement here as well.

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,690
Now let's jump in to code and explore each of these cars trucks in action
