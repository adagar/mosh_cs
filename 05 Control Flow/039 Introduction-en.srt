1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,480
This section you're going to explore conditional and iteration statements and C.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,190
We use these statements to control the flow of programs.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,300
So from this section you're going to start writing simple SUKAR programs.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,340
Now I have designed a number of programming exercises that you can find at the end of this section Whether

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,050
you're new to programming or been programming for a while.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,430
I highly recommend you to spend half an hour if you are going through these exercises because not only

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,290
will they help you remember the language syntax.

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,470
It will also train your programming brain which is absolutely crucial if you want to be a successful

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,400
programmer.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,920
So go through the lectures and spend some time doing the exercises.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,410
Now whether you solve the problem or get stuck I think still a good idea to look at my solutions as

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,280
a different way of solving the same problem.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,260
By the way my solutions are by no means perfect.

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,860
In fact there is no such thing as perfect in programming.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,270
You give a problem to 10 different developers and each comes with a different solution.

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,890
So do your best to solve the problem.

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,100
I look at my solutions for inspiration.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,980
Now let's get started.
