1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,740
OK we've got to itemization statements.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,100
If you have done programming before you know that pretty much every programming language has a set of

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:18,120
iteration statements which are used for repeatedly executing a sequence of statements in C-sharp we

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,040
have for our iteration statements 4 for each while and do while.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,800
So let's examine the syntax for each of these iteration statements for loops of three parts.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,390
Here's the first part semi-colon second part semi-colon and the third part the first part is what we

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,270
call the initialization clause and that's where we created a counter for controlling the number of times

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,120
the loop will be executed.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,990
So here I have created a counter called I set it to zero.

10
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,480
You're free to use any names for your counter valuables but I as a common convention.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,810
The second part is what we call the condition clause.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,790
So the for loop here will be executed as long as this condition is valid.

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,080
And the third part is what we call the iteration clause.

14
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,490
And here we typically increment or decrement the counter variable.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,720
So here because I said I 2 0 I would increment i in every iteration until it reaches 10.

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,660
And inside the body of the four block we have a sequence of statements that will execute repeatedly

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,210
for each is used to iterate over elements of an Enumerable object.

18
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,170
What do I mean by enumerable.

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,740
In simple words that means anything that has some kind of list or array nature.

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,660
So far you have learned about arrays and the strings and string as you know is a sequence of characters

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,200
so the string is enumerable.

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,760
The array type is also enumerable.

23
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,880
So anything that has some kind of list nature is enumerable and we can use 4:8 to iterate over their

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,850
elements.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,650
We can definitely do the same thing with a for loop but doing that with 4 h is easier and cleaner in

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,580
terms of syntax.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,030
Here is one for each block looks like we have a local or temporary variable in this case or call it

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,770
number.

29
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,940
And here we have the in key word.

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,820
And here's the list or object that we are iterating.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,770
So assuming that numbers is an array of integers in every iteration number will hold the value in the

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,730
current element of the array.

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,280
And C-Sharp we also have y loops in terms of syntax a y loop includes a condition here in practices

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,880
as long as this condition is valid the loop will execute.

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,440
Typically we have a counter that we initialize before the while loop is executed and at the end of the

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,620
while loop we increment it.

37
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,930
So as you see it is kind of similar to for a loop but it has a different syntax.

38
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,370
Whether you use for or why loop it's up to you it's kind of personal preference.

39
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,490
And finally we have do while loops do while is a slightly different from while we do while loop the

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:16,090
loop is executed at least once because the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop.

41
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,030
So here we have do a block of statements that will execute.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,940
We have our counter which we increment or decrement and eventually is the condition.

43
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,980
Now you don't always need a counter with a while and do while loops.

44
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,720
You can use any condition in this lines here.

45
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,900
I used a counter call I to demonstrate that the same thing can be implemented with a for a while or

46
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,960
with a do while loop.

47
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,050
And finally before you start coding Let me show you two more statements here.

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,350
We have break and continue.

49
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,600
So in any loops we can use break to jump out of the loop or continue to jump to the next guy to ration

50
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,320
.

51
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,230
Now let's start coding and see what all of this means in action.
