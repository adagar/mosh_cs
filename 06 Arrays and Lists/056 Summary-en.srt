OK this section you'll learn more about C-Sharp race you'll learn that in our array's a fixed size which

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,230
means once you allocate them you cannot change their size.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,140
So if you want to work with a dynamic array you need to use a list now these days.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,650
Ninety nine point nine percent of the time we use lists not a race but you might be working with a third

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,530
party library or a legacy code base.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,350
And you we still have to use arrays.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,320
So remember the syntax I'd prefer for use lists.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,290
I hope you enjoyed the section.

00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,240
And thank you for watching
