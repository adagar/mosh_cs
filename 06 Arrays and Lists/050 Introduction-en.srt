00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,060
Okay at this point you know a little bit about race in this section.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going to expand your knowledge of bag arrays and introduce you to multi dimensional warriors.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,510
This is useful if you're working with structures such as a matrix.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,430
I'm also going to talk about generic lists which are very useful in building real world applications

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:23,970
.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,660
Again similar to the last section I have designed some exercises to help you train your programming

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,280
brain.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,340
So be sure to go through the lectures and spend half an hour doing your exercises.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,310
Now this started
