You don't need to have ReSharper to take my courses, but having it installed, helps you write code a lot faster with less work. </p><p style="">You can get a free 30-day trial version of ReSharper if you like to use it while watching my courses. Based on Udemy's policies, I'm not allowed to add the link to ReSharper here. So I leave it to you to download and install it. </p><p style=""><strong style="">If you're a student or work in open-source projects, you can get a free license. </strong></p><p style=""><br style=""></p></p>
